# Creating a shield to send data from a SGS24ISS gas sensor to a LoRaWAN Network

Authors: Arthur Gautheron, Olivier Lagrost

## 📝 Objectives and Block Diagram

The final objective of the Smart Devices UF is to "design and build a smart device based on the combination of a gas sensor and an electronic card to communicate information over a low speed network". It is a pluridisciplinary subject that combines skills from all educational backgrounds included in the PTP. GP (physics) students are best at designing a PCB and creating datasheets. AE (electronics) students, such as ourselves, prefer electrical schematics, embedded programming and have a better understanding of how to design the whole system overall. Finally, IR (computer science) students are better at understanding how to communicate data over LoRaWAN.

This repository aims at explaining our work on this system.

SGS24ISS is the name we decided to give to our homemade gas sensor. It stands for "Smart Gas Sensor 2024 Innovative Smart Systems".
