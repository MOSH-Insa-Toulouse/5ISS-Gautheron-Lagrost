# Creating a shield to send data from a SGS24ISS gas sensor to a LoRaWAN Network

Authors: Arthur Gautheron, Olivier Lagrost

## üìù Objectives and Block Diagram

The final objective of the Smart Devices UF is to "design and build a smart device based on the combination of a gas sensor and an electronic card to communicate information over a low speed network". It is a pluridisciplinary subject that combines skills from all educational backgrounds included in the PTP. GP (physics) students are best at designing a PCB and creating datasheets. AE (electronics) students, such as ourselves, prefer electrical schematics, embedded programming and have a better understanding of how to design the whole system overall. Finally, IR (computer science) students are better at understanding how to communicate data over LoRaWAN.

This repository aims at explaining our work on this system.

SGS24ISS is the name we decided to give to our homemade gas sensor. It stands for "Smart Gas Sensor 2024 Innovative Smart Systems". The objective of the project is to collect data from the smart sensor, monitor its internal temperature for optimal measurements, and send the collected data over LoRa to a Chirpstack server to be processed and used in an eventual application.

## üßë‚Äçüî¨ Sensor design and creation

The SGS24ISS gas sensor is capable of detecting the presence of several gases depending on their concentration. The sensor is able to perform multiple tasks:
* Returns current that depends on the concentration of gas around the sensor.
* Measure its own internal temperature.
* Increase its own temperature with an integrated heater.

For more information about the sensor, please read its datasheet [here](https://github.com/Timanoin/lora_app/blob/main/datasheet.pdf).

## üíª Sensor Acquisition System

To collect data from the sensor, the current emitted by the sensor must be transformed into voltage, since MCUs cannot acquire current intensity. The system developed to acquire this information is a transimpedance amplifier.
The ![LTSpice directory](https://github.com/Timanoin/lora_app/tree/main/_LTSpice) contains the schematic of such an acquisition system, as well as other simulations to model the gas sensor.

The transimpedance amplifier is composed of 4 stages.
* Low-pass filter of cut-off frequency 16Hz to remove noise from the sensor.
* Low-pass filter of cut-off frequency 1.6Hz to remove noise from the mains supply.
* Non-inverting amplifier.
* Low-pass filter of cut-off frequency 1600Hz as an anti-aliasing filter.

The resistance of the gas sensor is determined as follows:

## ‚úèÔ∏è Shield Electrical Schematic

The schematics tested in simulation with LTSpice are recreated into KiCad for future PCB creation. All pins from the SGS24ISS (gas sensor, temperature sensor, heater) are connected to the Arduino pins. The RN2483 LoRa communication chip and its antenna are also connected to the Arduino in the schematic.
The KiCad files can be found ![here](https://github.com/Timanoin/lora_app/tree/main/_KiCad).

## ‚ö° Shield PCB Design

The PCB is routed on the bottom layer, since pins of THT components must be soldered on the copper covered side of the PCB.

The resulting PCB is pretty small, but it could be even smaller if another MCU was used for data acquisition (like an Arduino Nano or a STM32).
