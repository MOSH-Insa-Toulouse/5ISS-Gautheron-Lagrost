# Creating a shield to send data from a gas sensor to a LoRaWAN Network

The final objective of the Smart Devices UF is to "design and build a smart device based on the combination of a gas sensor and an electronic card to communicate information over a low speed network". It is a pluridisciplinary subject that combines skills from all educational backgrounds included in the PTP. GP (physics) students are best at designing a PCB and creating datasheets. AE (electronics) students, such as ourselves, prefer electrical schematics, embedded programming and have a better understanding of how to design the whole system overall. Finally, IR (computer science) students are better at understanding how to communicate data over LoRaWAN. They will learn the most out of this UF.

This repository aims at explaining our work on this system.

## 📝 Objectives and Block Diagram

## 🧑‍🔬 Sensor design and creation

## ✏️ Shield Electrical Schematic

## ⚡ Shield PCB Design

## 💻 Arduino Uno Embedded Software

## 📻 ChirpStack

## 📱 User Interface Design

prototype a system onto a breadboard with an Arduino Uno, a Grove gas sensor and a RN2483 chip. This system should be able to communicate over LoRa with a ChirpStack server hosted by INSA.
